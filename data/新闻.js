    "details": "??On 3 November, the US Federal Reserve launched its second round of quantitative easing monetary policy, namely the purchase of US$600 billion of long-term US Treasury bonds by the end of June 2011, to stimulate the US economic recovery. This policy has sparked widespread questions and criticism around the world. Critics believe that the actual effect of the Fed's \"printing of money\" to stimulate economic recovery is unpredictable and will lead to a flood of liquidity and devaluation of the US dollar, a rise in commodity prices and an influx of \"hot money\" to other countries, endangering international economic and financial stability and global economic recovery.
